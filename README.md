# ActiveFloor Lava Floor

## Description

The project is about creating an educational, cooperative game for kids between the age of 10 to 12 for the ActiveFloor. The game is projected from the ActiveFloor system to the floor, and you interact with the game by using your feet. The concept of the game is that two players are working together to solve math equation/ geography question by jumping on the correct rock platform surrounded by lava. 
The goal of this project is to improve kids learning goals/ subject and keep their body moving in an active way, while learning how to work together and have fun.

## Subjects

The current educational subjects that the game has is math and geography.

## Files in the project

Currently all the files in the project are neatly places in their respective folder.  Everything is categorized. In the ‘Scenes’ folder there is a folder called Personal Sandboxes. That’s where you create a scene where nobody else can see it. Only you can see it and use.
The ‘Lava’ folder in the ‘Material’ folder is to use for the LavaMaterialSwitcher script. That was used for testing out the lava animation in the TestLavaRising scene in 'Testing' folder in 'Scenes' folder. It is currently in no use. You can use it for some brainstorm lava animation.
The ‘Shaders’ and ‘Textures’ folder are packages from the unity store for the lava background. [Here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/lava-flowing-shader-33635)


## How to build the project.

## How to run the project.
To run the project, you need an android device to run the .apk file. Installing the .apk file on your android device to start the game. [Here](https://fontysmade.nl/activefloor-lava-floor/) you’ll find an example instruction build of the current version of the game for android.
